This site will be the new home of WAJO (Western Australian Junior mathematics Olympiad), and
associated ventures supported by WAMOC (Western Australian Mathematics Olympiad Committee), 
such as the Phill Schultz Prize (awarded each year to the best-performing Western Australian
high school student in mathematics olympiad competitions that year), and Special WAMOC Awards
awarded each year to Western Australian high school students who have been invited to the 
School of Excellence/Selection School which are intensive training schools for the IMO (International
Mathematics Olympiad) run by the AMT (Australian Mathematics Olympiad).
